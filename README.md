# JavaScriptChallenge-01
This project is my first java script project.
You can change to backgroundcolor if you click on buttom "click me"
you can also choose simple or hex, because there are only four options ["green", "red", "rgba(133,122,200)", "#f15025"]
in simple option but there are so much options in hex option.
